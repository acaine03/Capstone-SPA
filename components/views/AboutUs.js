                or have recently graduated high school. EYF is open for anyone who is looking for guidance on
                managing finances, buying a decent vehicle, needing help finding a place 
                to continue education, finding a place to live within your financial means, furnishings for
                your home and seeking counseling for all of the above and more! EYF's goal is to educate young adults
                about finances and show them how to stay out of a lot of debt.

            <p>EYF understands that majority of us will not, or have not, received education in high schools on how to
                live in the "real world". Growing up, for most of us, resulted in a never ending cycle of living 
                paycheck to paycheck because that's what is "normal" in the world today. EYF wants to stop this
                cycle and give you something to look forward to -- financial freedom.

        <div class="paragraph-3">
            <p>Financial freedom doesn't mean you'll be rich or wealthy. It simply means that you will be able to 
                live comfortably and not have to worry about if you'll have enough money to pay the rent,
                or, if your vehicle gives you a "surprise" that will need immediate attention to be fixed. If you
                feel like <b>Envisioning Your Future</b>, then feel free to <a href="ContactUs">contact us</a>
